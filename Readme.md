[OpenRA](https://openra.net) - Red Alert Classic dedicated server hosted on RaspberryPi 3b+. 

To join the game use the [OpenRA](https://openra.net) launcher and select The Chill Island server from the multiplayer menu.

## About

- `./launch-dedicated.sh` - used to start the server. Original script from OpenRA server.
- `./editmotd.sh` - script used to update the `motd.txt` file. this file must be eddited accordingly as per in-file instruction. More info on the `motd.txt` file [here](https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/wiki/Dedicated)
- `draw.txt` - text file containg your message(can be ascii draw);
- `motd.txt` - the `motd.txt` file generated which will be copied to the server location

Install pm2 to manage the server instance and store the output logs on the server. Using a cronjob on `./editmotd.sh` will make a repeat task job to update the Message of the day `motd.txt` file with your own.

Use pm2 log rotation for better performance.

 - [Nodejs/npm](https://nodejs.org/en/) - Node.jsÂ® is a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine. (this is not necessary but helful to run the server. also this is how it is deployed on the server.)
